## Network Basics

### What is a Network?
A **network** connects devices to share resources and communicate.

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A small network in one location (e.g., home, office).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Connects multiple LANs over large distances (e.g., city to city). The **Internet** is the largest WAN.

### Key Devices
- **Node**: Any connected device (computer, printer, phone).
- **Switch**: Connects devices *within* a LAN.
- **Router**: Connects *different* networks (e.g., your LAN to the Internet).
- **Modem**: Converts data for transmission over cable/phone lines.

### Client vs. Server
- **Client**: Requests data/services (e.g., your laptop, web browser).
- **Server**: Provides data/services (e.g., website host, email host).

### Bandwidth vs. Latency
- **Bandwidth**: The *width* of the highway. Higher bandwidth = more data can flow at once.
- **Latency**: The *delay* on the highway. Lower latency = faster trip for each data packet.
